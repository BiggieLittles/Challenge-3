# Challenge-3

This is a random password generator 

Through the use of multiple variables, functions, methods, if else statements, strings etc. I was able to get have prompts for you to generate a random password between 8-128 characters

The prompts allow the user to have an all alphabetical password or an all numerical password to all randomized characters
